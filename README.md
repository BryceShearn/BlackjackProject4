## Blackjack Project

### Overview

Blackjack App that allows the user to play against the dealer!

### How to Use

Card point values are face value, with the exception of Jack, Queen, King's which
are worth 10 points. Aces are worth 11 points. A player is dealt a card from a deck of 52 cards.
The player and dealer will compete until one player uses and the program will terminate.

### Technologies Used

1. Java, Eclipse, GitHub, and Git.

### Lessons Learned

1. Whenever possible, create method's at process steps in order to
   maintain organization, and ease of access for future maintenance.

2. Nested loops can make debugging more difficult, so limit processes
   by incrementing them in methods.
